# Assignment-MVC
  I have made a simple program to calculate the sum of two numbers using <b>MVC</b> Design pattern.<br>
  <ul>
  <li>For <b>View</b>, I have used java swings to create a user interface that will ask the user to input two <br>
    numbers and a button that will calculate the result and display on a textbox. </li>
